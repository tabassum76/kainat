      <p> My name is <span><b>Kainat Tabassum</b></span>, I belong to Kashmir and I live in Bhimber which is the district of Azad Kashmir. Itâ€™s a beautiful city surrounded by mountains and river. It has green meadows and lovely waterfall. It seems pretty as a picture. I have received my BS Computer Science degree from  <a href="http://must.edu.pk/" ><span><b> Mirpur University of Science & Technology</b></span></a> a with an aggregate 72.5% in 2018. During that period, I have attended labs and assisted the instructors as Teaching Assistant in multiple courses. I have worked under the supervision of my supervisor and made my final year project that is a web base project. In this I used PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and Bootstrap framework. I got 254/300 marks.  My hobbies are badminton, and travelling. Also I am good in teaching as I had taught junior classes during my summer vacations and still I am teaching intermediate level. Leadership quality is necessary for everyone who works with a team.
